<div class="disclaimer">
  Disclaimer: The following disclaimer applies to any research or services
  associated with the synthesis, extraction, or usage of compounds derived from
  frogs, including but not limited to naturally occurring or synthetically
  produced substances. This disclaimer aims to clarify the ethical, legal, and
  health-related considerations surrounding our research and services. Health
  and Safety Risks User Health Warning: Any compounds synthesized from frogs or
  through the use of frog-derived compounds are strictly intended for research
  purposes only. They are not intended for human consumption. These compounds
  have not been evaluated by health authorities for safety, efficacy, or dosage,
  and no claims are made about their suitability for therapeutic, recreational,
  or any other form of consumption. Use of these compounds in any unapproved
  manner may lead to serious health risks, including but not limited to
  toxicity, allergic reactions, neurological damage, cardiovascular issues, and
  psychological or behavioral effects. Research-Only Use: Compounds synthesized
  or provided through our service are to be used strictly within the bounds of
  research conducted by qualified individuals in appropriate laboratory
  settings. Handling and experimentation with these compounds should only be
  undertaken by individuals with proper training in chemical handling,
  toxicology, and animal welfare protocols. User Responsibility: Users of this
  service assume full responsibility for their actions and agree to operate
  within all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in their jurisdiction.
  This includes compliance with any laws regarding the use, possession,
  transportation, and disposal of potentially hazardous substances. We are not
  liable for any legal consequences that arise from the misuse or mishandling of
  these compounds. Health Monitoring and Safety Equipment: Individuals working
  with frog-derived compounds should be equipped with suitable safety gear,
  including gloves, masks, goggles, and lab coats. It is strongly recommended
  that users undergo regular health assessments to monitor for any adverse
  effects potentially arising from prolonged exposure. Inhalation, ingestion, or
  skin exposure to these compounds should be avoided at all costs, as they may
  pose significant health risks. Animal Welfare Considerations Animal
  Well-Being: We are fully committed to the ethical treatment of all animals,
  particularly frogs, used in the synthesis or extraction process. Our protocols
  are aligned with guidelines from relevant animal welfare organizations to
  ensure minimal impact on animal well-being. Any collection of frog samples or
  extracts is carried out by trained personnel following humane methods that
  prioritize the health and preservation of frog populations. Sustainable
  Practices: To reduce the ecological footprint of research on frogs, we adhere
  to sustainable practices and work with conservation partners wherever
  possible. Our goal is to limit the depletion of frog populations and support
  the ecological balance in their natural habitats. Alternative Research
  Methods: We actively invest in research to develop synthetic alternatives to
  compounds traditionally sourced from frogs. This initiative aims to reduce the
  dependency on animal-derived substances, promoting alternatives that do not
  impact frog populations. Ethics Approval and Oversight: All research projects
  undergo ethical review by an independent oversight committee to ensure that
  our practices align with high standards of animal welfare. Users should obtain
  any necessary ethics approvals in their own jurisdictions before utilizing
  frog-derived compounds in their research. Legal and Regulatory Compliance
  Regulatory Status of Compounds: Frog-derived compounds, whether synthesized or
  naturally extracted, may be subject to regulatory restrictions in different
  jurisdictions. We do not guarantee that our compounds are permitted in all
  locations. Users are responsible for determining the legal status of these
  compounds within their own country or region. Export and Import Compliance:
  Shipping of frog-derived compounds across borders is strictly controlled, and
  we cannot guarantee the ability to export or import these compounds to certain
  jurisdictions. It is the user’s responsibility to obtain any necessary
  permits, licenses, or certifications for the import or use of these compounds.
  Liability Waiver: By using our service, the user agrees to indemnify and hold
  harmless our organization from any liability, damage, or loss arising from
  improper handling, unauthorized distribution, misuse, or adverse reactions
  related to the compounds provided. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations of
  Liability No Warranties: All services and compounds provided are on an “as is”
  basis, without any warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. We
  make no guarantee that the compounds are fit for any particular purpose, nor
  do we make any representations regarding their stability, purity, or specific
  effects. Limitation of Liability: Our organization is not responsible for any
  direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from
  the use, misuse, or inability to use the compounds or services provided. This
  includes but is not limited to damages related to health, legal, regulatory,
  or financial consequences that may arise from handling these compounds.
  Updates to Disclaimer: This disclaimer is subject to change at any time
  without notice. Users are responsible for reviewing the latest version of this
  disclaimer prior to engaging in any research or usage of frog-derived
  compounds. Educational and Informational Use Only The information provided by
  our organization is for educational and informational purposes only and is not
  intended to substitute professional advice in medical, legal, environmental,
  or ethical fields. Users should seek guidance from qualified professionals to
  ensure the responsible handling, disposal, and ethical considerations related
  to the use of frog-derived compounds. Acceptance of Terms By engaging with our
  service, users agree to the terms outlined in this disclaimer. This agreement
  is binding upon any individual, organization, or entity that interacts with,
  purchases, or otherwise utilizes compounds or services related to frog-derived
  substances.
